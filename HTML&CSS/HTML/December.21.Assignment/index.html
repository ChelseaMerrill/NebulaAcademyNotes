                        <p>This is my best friend/sister of ten+ years, Kelly.  We met in high school, but our friendship was forged during a 3-week exchange trip to Germany.  Although we did live together for a brief few years, almost all of our friendship has been long distance.  Long-distance is never a fun thing to do with anyone but we always made it work. This is us at her surprise Toy Story baby shower.</p>

                        <p>Chase Cameron was born on May 3, 2019.  Shortly after being born, Kelly and Chase moved from Florida to North Carolina and while they may have been 500 miles closer, it still meant that between settling into their new house and me getting the time off of work, it was going to be a while before I could meet my nephew.</p>

                        <p>After several months I finally got to meet my little love. This was arguable one of the best moments in my life.  Becoming an Aunt was something that I always new was going to be fantastic, but I severely underestimated how much it would change my life for the better.  Having Chase in my life has been one of the most wonderful and rewarding experiences of my life.</p>

                        <p>Kelly and I had a good system of traveling to each other every three months or so but then COVID happened and our visits had to be out on hold for over a year. Because of the distance and pandemic, we obviously do not get to see each other often we make sure that we have lots of FaceTime playdates. These can difficult because I do not know if you have ever tried to engage virtually with a toddler, but it is not an easy task. </p>

                        <p>We really wanted to spend the holidays together so everyone quarantined and got tested so that we could spend our first Christmas together since Kelly moved away six years ago. Obviously working a full-time job and being a student doesnâ€™t leave me with a ton of time to devote to them during their visit so Chase is making sure the help me out with my homework assignments. </p>
